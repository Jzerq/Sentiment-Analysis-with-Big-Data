# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Big-Data

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system to classify SubReddit AITA posts into
YTA, NTA, and Neutral categories. Utilizing MongoDB for data storage and Apache Spark for
scalable data processing, the project will use natural language processing techniques for text
preprocessing and feature extraction. A RandomForestClassifier will be trained and evaluated to
ensure accurate classification. Additionally, common words and phrases will be identified, and
sentiment analysis will be performed to provide insights into the language used in different
contexts. Visualization tools like WordCloud and Plotly will enhance data interpretation,
demonstrating the practical application of big data technologies and NLP in social media analysis.
