# Reddit Sentiment Analysis Using PySpark with Big Data

This project aims to develop a sentiment analysis system for classifying SubReddit AITA posts into YTA, NTA, and Neutral categories, using MongoDB for data storage and Apache Spark for scalable data processing. <br>
A data pipeline with tokenization, stop word removal, n-grams, and TF-IDF is implemented to prepare text data for machine learning. <be>
A RandomForestClassifier was trained and evaluated using PySpark's MLlib, achieving high metric scores on validation and test datasets. <br>
Additionally, sentiment analysis was performed to extract insights into common words and phrases across contexts. <br>
Visualization tools like WordCloud and Plotly were used for enhanced interpretation of results, showcasing the practical application of big data technologies and natural language processing in social media analysis. <br>
Finally, a sentiment prediction function was deployed to test the model with new text inputs for real-world usage.
